# GA_for_Network_Design
Computational results collected from an experiment of a Genetic Algorithm for a covering network design problem (see https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11750-019-00537-x)
For this experiment we have used instances with 20 and 80 nodes generated in a random manner. There are 20 underlying networks of each size. The percentage of available budget is fixed to 0.4.

We show the average values of the differents variables taken into account (value of the demand convered, the overall execution time, the relative percent deviation with respect to the best solution found by a GRASP routine)
